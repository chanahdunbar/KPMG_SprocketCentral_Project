# KPMG Sprocket Central Project

This project aims to ensure data quality, conduct an exploratory analysis of sale/order trends, and provide a recommendation of a new business strategy.

## Data Quality Evaluation
The first task was to conduct a data quality assessment on the provided data received by KPMG AU's virtual internship program. I checked for whether or not the data adhered to the Dimensions of Data Quality including:
- Data Currency
- Integrity
- Accuracy
- Completeness
- Duplication
- Consistency
And drafted an email to the Sprocket Central that would be using and making decisions based off of the analyzed data. The email include details about the quality evaluation as well as recommendations of how to avoid the issues in the future.

## Data Exploration
The second task was to explore the data and give a recommendation on how the company's marketing team could boost business. I focused on the company's top spending customers, and the profits and online orders throughout the year for each quarter. After creating charts and graphs outlining my findings I put the insights into a presentation along with recommendations on how the company could improve.
